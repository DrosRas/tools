
what we need to do
establish a connection with a machine
establish a connection with a specific port
if we manage to connect the port is open if not its closed.
socket library allows us to establish a connection through the interned
Ask the user to input an ip address and a port or a port range
with the given information we try to connect with the socket library tools
if we connect we can print out the open ports 
if we dont we print out there are no open ports
we can create a function that scans a port
then for a given range of ports run the function
convert a domain name given to an ip address we do this with the ip library and socket library so the user can enter either
then we can modify our program to scan multiple targets in another function
finaly we can try getting a 'banner' from the ports that are open to get more information on what they are running,we do that with another function.
